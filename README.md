# Portfolio

making a portfolio with the css we learned the past few weeks

The past week or so I have been working on this portfolio, it is not the best I couldve done only because i realized how wrong I was doing it a bit too late. But I will use this as a learning experience. I'd say ive dont a good job with the top half of this portfolio. The downside is I have a bad habit of using the margin attribute to position things in this portfolio.

I made this portfolio not only for a school project but for future use, so I can display the work accomplished to possible employers I meet later on.
